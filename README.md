# ACEs and Parenting



## **Insights**

**1. Behaviour of the Parent**
- Parents who experienced **adversity in childhood** are more likely to rely on **harsh discipline** (like corporal punishment).
- This effect persists even when controlling for mental health symptoms → meaning it’s not just about depression or stress, but possibly about learned models of parenting.
- Female parents (possibly due to being more present in daily caregiving) reported using corporal punishment more.

**2. Future of the Child**
- Exposure to corporal punishment is strongly linked (from broader literature) to:
  - Higher **aggression** and **externalizing behaviours** (acting out, defiance).
  - Lower **emotional regulation** and **trust**.
  - Increased risk of **cycle of violence** → children who are punished harshly are more likely to use aggression in adulthood.
- Therefore, children of parents with high ACEs face a **double risk**:
  - Direct exposure to corporal punishment.
  - Potential intergenerational transmission of trauma (they may themselves parent harshly later).

**Conclusion**
**Parental ACEs are a strong predictor of corporal punishment, independent of mental health factors.**
This suggests that **ACEs shape parenting styles directly**, likely through learned behaviour models.
**For the child**, increased corporal punishment raises **risks of negative socio-emotional outcomes and perpetuates the intergenerational cycle of trauma**.
